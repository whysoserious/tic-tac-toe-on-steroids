# tic-tac-toe-on-steroids

This is game of tictactoe but with a twist - you compete with an opponent on 9 boards instead of one. Read more about rules [here](http://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/06/16/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/).

This is still __work in progress__. For now I finished rules engine and ultra simple GUI. 

## TODO:
* AI
* better GUI (but I want to use ASCII only. I like ASCII).
* multiplayer (well, nice to have)

## Testing

```
lein cljsbuild test
```

## Running 

```
lein figwheel
```
